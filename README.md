# cityscape
City landscape for Minetest

This mod makes very rudimentary city blocks. It's more of an experiment than anything, but might be fun for someone to play with. Right now it generates nearly identical buildings and streets. It might be fun for zombie attack games or just blowing things up.

In the future, I hope to make the streets connect properly between chunks and put some stairs and possibly walls inside the buildings.
