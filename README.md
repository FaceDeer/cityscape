# cityscape
City landscape for Minetest

This mod makes very rudimentary city blocks. It's more of an experiment than anything, but might be fun for someone to play with. Right now it generates a small selection of buildings and simple streets and sewers. It could be terrain for zombie attack games or just blowing things up.

City blocks will generate any place that's relatively flat and largely above water level. Natural terrain is left alone everywhere else.
