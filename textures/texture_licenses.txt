The cityscape_broken_3.png, cityscape_broken_3_low.png and cityscape_plate_glass.png textures are based on the default minescape textures, and so fall under the LGPL2 license.

The original car texture was created by Melkor, and is distributed under the CC-BY-NC-SA license (see the models directory).

All other textures are CC0.
